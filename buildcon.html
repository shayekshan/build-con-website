            <p>Also known as plasterboards or drywall, gypsum plasterboards are prefabricated, ready-to-install calcium
                sulfate boards used for false ceilings. These come in different thicknesses and sizes, such as 9, 12,
                and 15 mm, and 4 x 6 feet, 4 x 8 feet, and 4 x 10 feet, respectively.Gypsum can serve as a soil
