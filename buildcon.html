            <p>Also known as plasterboards or drywall, gypsum plasterboards are prefabricated, ready-to-install calcium
                sulfate boards used for false ceilings. These come in different thicknesses and sizes, such as 9, 12,
                and 15 mm, and 4 x 6 feet, 4 x 8 feet, and 4 x 10 feet, respectively.Gypsum can serve as a soil
                amendment, providing a source of calcium, sulfur, and plant nutrients to your gardens or crops. It can
                also loosens dense soil structures like heavy clay soils and sandy soils by binding small clay particles
                in a process called flocculation to improve soil aeration and water movement.</p>

            <h3>One of the many advantages of using it for ceiling design is its ability to provide fire protection. It
                is completely heat resistant and doesn't embrace temperature either from the atmospheric heat or
                electricity wires within the house. The most cost-effective, sturdy, and durable false ceiling material,
                gypsum false ceilings are made from gypsum plasterboards that are affixed to metal sheets with screws.
                These boards are factory-manufactured and ready-to-install. Since they come in large sheets, they are
                easier to install and leave no dust in the process.
                Gypsum ceilings are known for their hydrophobic
                properties and hence make it a suitable choice for kitchens and bathrooms, whereas its non-combustible
                core makes it a good choice for commercial spaces. </h3>
